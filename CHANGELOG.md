0.7.6
----

New features:

* [#86](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/86) adds support for custom serialisation. Thanks to @lloydmeta

  Note that the addition of this feature may require you to add type annotations in your code in places where you are
  getting items from the cache (e.g. `get[String]("foo")` instead of `get("foo")`).

0.7.5 (2015/12/10)
----

New features:

* [#81](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/81) adds support for sharded Redis and Redis Sentinel. Thanks to @jareddellitt and @ctblog for the original PRs (#66 and #78) that inspired this.

Improvements:

* Added support for passing `Duration.Inf` or `Duration.Undefined` as a TTL. It is interpreted as meaning "cache with no TTL".

Other stuff:

* Bumped Jedis version from 2.7.2 to 2.8.0.

0.7.4 (2015/11/22)
----

Improvements:

* Bumped Caffeine to v2.0.1. Version 2 of Caffeine contains [performance and cache efficiency improvments](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

Bug fixes:

* [#73](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/73) fixes a typo in the new variant of `memoize` that was added in #72 (thanks to @mdedetrich)

0.7.3 (2015/11/09)
----

Improvements:

* [#72](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/72) adds some convenience methods that take an optional TTL as an `Option[Duration]` (thanks to @mdedetrich)

0.7.2 (2015/10/29)
----

New features:

* [#71](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/71) adds a new cache implementation, [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) (thanks to @mchv)

0.7.1 (2015/10/27)
----

Bug fixes:

* [#69](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/69) fixes an integer overflow issue when using a TTL longer than Int.MaxValue milliseconds (about 23 days) with Guava.

Other stuff:

* Bumped the sbt plugins. Some of them were pretty ancient.

0.7.0 (2015/09/27)
----

New features:

* [#55](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/55) adds a Typed API, so you can ensure you don't accidentally read/write something of the wrong type. See the README for more details.
* [#62](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/62) adds asynchronous versions of `caching` and `memoize`. See the README for more details.

Breaking API changes (sorry!):

 #62 resulted in a few breaking changes, as follows:

* `scalacache.caching` and `scalacache.cachingWithTTL` have been renamed to `scalacache.sync.caching` and `scalacache.sync.cachingWithTTL` respectively. This is to make way for the new asynchronous versions of these methods.
* `scalacache.getSync` has been deprecated and will be removed soon. Please use `scalacache.sync.get` instead.
* Both of the overloaded `scalacache.memoization.memoize` methods have been renamed to `scalacache.memoization.memoizeSync`. This is to make way for the new asynchronous versions of these methods.

Other stuff:

* README fixes
* Bump Scala, sbt
* Use macro bundles, thanks to @philwills

0.6.4 (2015/07/10)
----

Improvements:

* [#50](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/50) adds a `removeAll()` method to the `Cache` class, so you can flush the entire contents of the cache.

Bumped dependencies:

* Scala 2.11.7

0.6.3 (2015/05/17)
----

Improvements:

* [#49](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/49) adds a `close()` method to the `Cache` class, so you can clean up resources properly (i.e. close the Memcached/Redis client) when your app shuts down.

Bumped dependencies:

* Ehcache 2.8.4 -> 2.10.0
* Spymemcached 2.11.4 -> 2.11.7
* Jedis 2.6.0 -> 2.7.2

0.6.1 (2015/04/01)
----

Improvements:

* [#40](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/pull/40) (Add exception handling to `memoize` blocks, so exceptions thrown by the cache implementation are caught and handled gracefully. See [#39](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/issues/39) for the bug report)

0.6.0 (2015/03/14)
----

Improvements:

* [#38](https://github.com/cb372/scalacache/issues/38) (make `RedisCache` thread-safe)

Breaking changes:

* Due to #38, `RedisCache` now takes a `JedisPool` in its constructor rather than a `Jedis`.
